**#CSCP 120 Lab Work**

*My Favorite Lab*

---

**Lab 1**

This lab was one of the best labs because I was able to have the computer output what I wanted from scratch.  This is similar to cooking, and the food is delicious.  The Hello World made me feel in control.

**Lab 5, part 1**


This Lab was fantastic for understanding loops.  I enjoy being able to put in practice what I learned into actual reality.  This is a form, other than Exams, to see if I understand a topic.

**Lab 11**

This whole lab was interesting in the case where I got to ask the density of a population.  I never understood how Google was able to carry this out, but now I am able to code this process.  Great lab and experience.
